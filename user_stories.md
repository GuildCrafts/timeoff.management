# Timeoff Management Challenge

## Getting started

### Familiarize yourself with the codebase

1. First step of approaching a new codebase is to read the [README](README.md).

2. Next, get the code up and running. Checkout the [README](README.md) and look for instructions to get a local development copy of the repo up and running and play around with it.

2. Next, run all the tests locally, to make sure they are passing. You'll need phantomjs installed: `npm install phantomjs`

3. Next, checkout the [database design](docs/db_design.txt). Load it up in [sql designer](http://sql.apps.learnersguild.org/) and familiarize yourself with the schema.

4. Finally, look around the other folders and get a sense of how the code is organized, and what the technology stack is.
